# Floating point numbers explained with the Walpiri language, big boring tables, and a bit of algebra that doesn’t work

This was originally a lecture from [Materialise Academy C++](http://www.materialise.com/en/careers/ukraine/materialise-academy-c?Source=techblog). Since we don’t sell education, we benefit from it, it is only logical to share our teaching materials with the rest of the world.

This particular piece is about floating point numbers. It is not about the theory behind it, you can read that on Wikipedia just fine, but mostly about pitfalls and dark corners. It might seem negatively written to you, but it is not made out of despair, but rather out of respect for complexity and all the challenge it brings.
